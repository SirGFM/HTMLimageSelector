Simple HTML5/JS image selector. Only tested with Google Chrome, on Ubuntu, but should work anywhere... hopefully.

1. Open `index.html` on any browser
2. Set the image's dimensions
    * **NOTE**: This cannot be changed once the picture has been loaded
3. Set the number of images per row and click on 'Update'
    * **NOTE**: This **can** be modified anytime
4. Click on 'Choose Files' and select every image that should be displayed
    * **NOTE**: The images will be displayed in alphabetical order (I think...), instead of the order they were selected!
    * Selecting new/more images will add these new images to the end of the list
5. Click on the image that you want to modify

There's currently no easy way to reset the images other than refreshing the page and adding everything again...
